      model_scan_ttl_hours (default 24), skip the network call entirely and
      just return the cached claude_models array — most process starts hit
      this branch, no API call at all.
    - If the cache is stale (or `force=True`), attempt one live scan via
      fetch_fn (defaults to fetch_live_models). On success, claude_models AND
      claude_models_checked_at are updated together, atomically, in

      rate limit) nothing is written — config.toml is left exactly as it
      was, and the old cached array is returned as-is for this process.
      This is deliberate: it's what lets CI's smoke_test.py spawn
      mcp_server.py with a placeholder API key and never have that touch
      config.toml or need real network access — it always just reads
      whatever was last committed.

    dependency-injection shape as fetch_live_models()'s own `client`
    parameter) — every real caller (main.py) uses the defaults, which are
    the real config.toml and the real live Anthropic scan. See
    smoke_test.py's check_model_refresh() for the fake-client-driven
    regression coverage this enables with no real network or file mutation.

    Reads use stdlib tomllib (same as load_claude_models() — no extra
    dependency, always available). tomlkit (comment-preserving write) is
    only imported lazily, right before the actual write, and only reached
    after a live scan has already succeeded — so a scan that fails (as it
    always does against CI's placeholder key) never even touches tomlkit,
