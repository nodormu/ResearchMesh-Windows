      just return the cached claude_models array — most process starts hit
      this branch, no API call at all.
    - If the cache is stale (or `force=True`), attempt one live scan via
      fetch_fn (defaults to fetch_live_models). On success, claude_models AND
      claude_models_checked_at are updated together, atomically, in

      rate limit) nothing is written — config.toml is left exactly as it

      This is deliberate: it's what lets CI's smoke_test.py spawn
      mcp_server.py with a placeholder API key and never have that touch

    regression coverage this enables with no real network or file mutation.

    dependency, always available). tomlkit (comment-preserving write) is
    only imported lazily, right before the actual write, and only reached
    after a live scan has already succeeded — so a scan that fails (as it
    always does against CI's placeholder key) never even touches tomlkit,

    Posts to `client.beta.messages.create` — a deliberate holdover from when
    the local `computer` tool needed a beta header (see BETAS above, now
    empty). Kept rather than reverted to the plain endpoint because the beta
    endpoint is a strict superset; top-level `cache_control` works on both, so
    prompt caching is unaffected either way.

    **Per-model tool-compatibility handling.** Not every Anthropic-defined
    tool type works on every model — confirmed live: Claude Haiku 4.5 flatly
    rejects `computer_toolset_20260801` (a real, permanent model limitation,
    not a schema bug — Haiku doesn't support the older `computer_20251124`
    either; `computer_20250124` is accepted but deliberately not declared).
    Declaring an unsupported tool type fails the WHOLE request, not just the
    incompatible tool, so a `/model swap` to an incompatible model would
    otherwise 400 on every single turn until swapped back — including turns
    that never touch the offending tool at all.

    `_unsupported_by_model` remembers what has been discovered incompatible,
    per model name, for the life of this process (reset only by restarting —
    `/model swap` itself never clears it, so swapping back to a
    previously-bad model doesn't need rediscovery). `chat()` proactively
    filters against it before every request, and reactively grows it by
    parsing a live "does not support tool types: ..." 400 the first time a
    given model/tool pairing is actually tried — no hand-maintained
    compatibility table to fall out of date, since it adapts to whatever the
    real API says, for any current or future tool.
